<h4>AN</h4>
<h2>ACCOUNT</h2>
<h4>OF THE</h4>
<h3>GROWTH</h3>
<h4>OF</h4>
<h1>DEISM&middot;</h1>
<p><em>SIR</em>,</p>
<p>&#39;Tis now three Years since you and I had a serious Discourse concerning the
rise and progress of <em>Deism</em>: which is an Opinion of late Years crept
into <em>England</em>, tho not so widely spread here as in other parts of <em>
Europe</em>. I well remember we were both agreed, that there was no shadow of
Reason why any one should suspect the <em>Gospels</em> of Forgery, since the
matter contain&#39;d in them hath not the least favour of any worldly Interest, or
indirect Design, but all the Lines of them do only center in the highest
Improvement Humane Nature is capable of. So that in conformity <span class="pagenum">[4]</span>every Man may take great comfort in himself, and all Mankind live
well with one another. Besides, the Preachers of this excellent Doctrine had at
first all the Discouragements which an irreligious and idolatrous Age could give
them, (as is confessed by their Enemies) insomuch that nothing but their own
personal full Conviction of the Truths they professed could engage them to
Preach &#39;em; and the intrinsick Goodness of the Law of <em>Christ</em>, was
sufficient to gain mens hearts, after <em>Miracles</em> had born down their
Prejudices, and gain&#39;d their serious Attention. In fine, you and I could see no
reason to doubt of the Truth of any matter of Fact contain&#39;d in the <em>Gospels</em>,
which relate the miraculous Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of <em>
Jesus Christ</em>; but what would oblige us to deny the truth of all History
whatsoever. And from these Considerations laid together, we concluded that the
Doctrine of our Lord <em>Jesus Christ</em> was undoubtedly sent to us by God.</p>
<p>This still made it appear more strange to us both, how <em>DEISM</em> (which
is a denial of all reveal&#39;d Religion) should creep in upon us where the <em>
Scriptures</em> are made so publick, and where so many Learned Treaties are
written, which so strongly assert their Authority to be Divine. I confess, I was
as desirous to know upon what Grounds Men rejected the <em>Gospel</em>, as you
your self were, and therefore I willingly undertook the Task you laid on me, <em>
viz.</em> To collect and put together those Motives whereby some had been
induced to lay aside all <em>Revelation</em>. For which Performance I was the
fitter, because it doth not require any Learning and strength of Wit, but only
Observation, and Inquiry, which I might easily make, because of the numerous
Acquaintance I have contracted in Town, where (you know) I spend the Winter, and
in the Country, where I bestow my Summer Visits. But all I shall <span class="pagenum">[5]</span>do in this matter, is barely to give you a Relation of those
Prejudices, and (as I think) false Reasonings, which have drawn some of my
Acquaintance from <em>Revelation</em> to <em>DEISM</em>.</p>
<p>1. Now, first I have observed, that some who pretend themselves <em>Deists</em>,
are Men of loose and sensual Lives; and I make no wonder that they dislike the <em>
Christian</em> Doctrine of Self-denial, and the severe threatnings against
wilful Sinners. You may be sure they will not alledge this Reason: But having
read <em>Spinosa</em> and <em>Hobbes</em>, and been taught to laugh at the story
of <em>Baalam</em>&#39;s Ass, and <em>Sampson</em>&#39;s Locks; they proceed to ridicule
the reality of all <em>Miracle</em> and <em>Revelation</em>. I have conversed
with several of this Temper, but could never get any of &#39;em serious enough to
debate the reality of <em>Revelation</em>: But a witty Jest and t&#39;other Glass
puts an end to all further Consideration. These are meer <em>Sceptics</em>, and
practical <em>Atheists</em>, rather than real <em>Deists</em>.</p>
<p>2. But there are others, who, although they have not a due regard to <em>
Revelation</em>, are Men of Sobriety and Probity, who with great freedom have
let me into their Thoughts, whereby I can very clearly and fully (as I think at
least) discern the rise and progress of this their Opinion, which is this;</p>
<p>1. In the time of King <em>Charles</em> the First, (which confineth my
longest acquaintance with Men) &#39;twas usual for Gentlemen to send their Sons
abroad into <em>Italy</em>, <em>Spain</em>, <em>France</em>, <em>Germany</em>, <em>
&amp;c.</em> to accomplish themselves by Travel. But lest they should be prevail&#39;d
upon to change their <em>Religion</em>, care was taken that their Tutor or
Governour, who travelled with &#39;em, should shew them the Idolatry and
Superstition of the <em>Roman Religion</em>; and also let &#39;em in to see that <em>
Popery</em> in all its Branches was only a device of the <em>Priesthood</em>, to
carry on a particular Interest of their own; to encrease their Wealth,<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
Honours, and Power over the Lay-people; to exalt the Head of their Order above
all the Crowned Heads in the World, and equal one whole Order of their Clergy, <em>
viz.</em> the Cardinals, to the Princes of <em>Christendom</em>. Nay, since all
People were obliged to make their Confessions to, and receive their Absolution
from the <em>Priest</em>, the meanest of which Order could create a God for the
People&#39;s Worship; &#39;tis plain, that their Religion was calculated for the Profit,
Power and Honour of the whole Order of the <em>Priesthood</em> in this World,
whatsoever advantages they might find by it in the other. Now the Young
Gentleman being throughly convinced of this Holy Cheat, returneth to Old <em>
England</em>; where he meets with very zealous Contests about Religion (as was
pretended) between the <em>Church</em> of <em>England</em>, headed by
Arch-Bishop <em>Laud</em> on the one part, and the <em>Presbyterian Kirk</em> on
the other; and having carefully read the Debate (as it appeared in the Prints)
on both sides, with those very Eyes which he had so lately cleared up in <em>
Italy</em> or <em>France</em>, he could not forbear to see that both these <em>
Protestant</em> Parties, under the pretence of Religion, were only grasping at <em>
Power</em>, and that the Controversy at bottom, was not who&#39;s Religion was best,
but only what Sect of the <em>Clergy</em> should make the best Market of the <em>
meer Lay-men</em>. And as this Young Gentleman had before resolved with himself
not to become a Property to the <em>Popish Priesthood</em>, no longer now will
he be such to the <em>Protestant Clergy</em> of any Denomination, since both
pursue the same Ends. He perceiveth that our <em>Protestant High-Priests</em> do
all of them rival the Sovereign Power; the <em>Bishop</em>&#39;s House like that of
the <em>King</em>, must be called his <em>Palace</em>, he must still keep up his
claim to the <em>Miter</em> and <em>Crosier</em>, to vie with the <em>Crown</em>
and <em>Scepter</em>; and as the<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
Stile of the King&#39;s Courts is <em>Anno Regni nostri</em>, i.e. In the Year of
our Reign: So that of the Bishop&#39;s Court is <em>Anno Consecrationis nostr&aelig;</em>,
i.e. In the Year of our Consecration; the Year of the King&#39;s Reign being unknown
in the Bishop&#39;s Court: The King speaking to the People doth usually call &#39;em his
Loving Subjects; the <em>Bishop</em> doth not make himself so familiar, but
stileth the People of his <em>Diocese</em> barely his Subjects, <em>
Jurisdictioni nostr&aelig; subditos</em>: The King is <em>Inthroned</em>, and the
Arch-Bishop <em>Inthronized</em>; both derive their Power from a <em>Divine
Right</em>; but the Bishop is the higher Power, because by the Principles of
Episcopacy he can Excommunicate the King, <em>i.e.</em> forbid him the very
Conversation of his Subjects, and thereby render them uncapable to make good
their Oath of Allegiance, in yielding their Aid and Assistance.</p>
<p>Nor do&#39;s he find that the <em>Presbytery</em> claims any inferior Powers;
each Party alledge <em>Scriptures</em> and <em>Fathers</em> on their side; and
for ought I can see, (says this Gentleman) they are all in the right. Through an
excess of Prejudice thus occasion&#39;d, he makes a further step towards <em>Deism</em>,
and Reasons after this manner: &#39;Tis not impossible (continues he) that the
ancient <em>Clergy</em> might be possess&#39;d with the same Spirit of Pride, which
has prevail&#39;d over the modern. If those Writings, which they call <em>Holy
Scriptures</em> are of their side, as they all say they are, I make no doubt but
they were of their own inventing; and if <em>Jesus Christ</em> their Patron,
laid the Foundation of those Powers, which both <em>Popish</em> and <em>
Protestant Clergy</em> claim to themselves from under him, I think the old <em>
Romans</em> did him right in punishing him with the death of a Slave. After this
manner I have heard it said of late, by another of the same Constitution, that
as the Church of <em>Rome</em> was a<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
modelled Faction against all other Christians, so was the Church of <em>England</em>,
by Law Established, against all other Protestants, who were by Law excluded from
every Office of Profit and Trust; who were made subject to the Piques and Malice
of every Church-man, and became a constant Revenue to Apparitors and Spiritual
Catch-poles. And though at present there be a <em>Toleration</em> by Law
granted, yet &#39;tis full opposed by the Spirit of the Church, as appears by
Sermons preached at Visitations, and the constant ordinary Discourses of the <em>
Clergy</em>, in which the Church of <em>England</em> is always represented, as
at this time, in greater danger than ever it was; though I should think the
danger had been as great in King <em>James</em>&#39;s Time: And notwithstanding the
Toleration (said he) no Man can enjoy a place of Profit or Trust, though he be
ever so dutiful a Subject, and ever so able or honest a Man, unless he hath a
Conscience by Law Established: By which Church-device Men are deprived of the
Privileges of their Country to which they are born, and for the discharge
whereof they never did in any respect incapacitate themselves; and hereby it
comes to pass, that the Nation cannot act vigorously in its own defence, being
debarr&#39;d the Use of one Moiety of it self; and notwithstanding this, they have
the Confidence to tell us Lay-men, that we ought to love our Neighbours as our
selves. Now if this be the way of the <em>Christians</em>, (concluded he) let my
Soul be with the <em>Philosophers</em>.</p>
<p>2. And this brings to my Thoughts what another <em>Deist</em> said jestingly
to me, <em>viz.</em> That since I was a Christian, &#39;twas lucky for me that I was
of the Bishop&#39;s Church; for though you were ever so Loyal (said he) to the King,
yet if you did not pay as dutiful an Allegiance to the Bishops, you could not
hold the Place you<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
now enjoy; for as certain as the <em>Cross</em> is above the <em>Crown</em>, so
sure a thing is it, that the <em>Bishop</em> will be above the <em>King</em>;
which he undertook would appear to me if I looked back to King <em>Charles</em>&#39;s
Restoration, or King <em>William</em>&#39;s Revolution. The <em>Presbyterians</em>,
though they quarrelled with <em>Charles</em> the First, yet became the loving
Subjects of <em>Charles</em> the Second; joined with the <em>Episcopalians</em>
in assisting him to the Throne, and made no scruple of Swearing their Allegiance
to him, and owning his Supremacy. But after all this, the King was not able to
support these his Loving Subjects against the Power of the Bishops, who in two
Years time outed &#39;em of their Livelihoods, and after that, drove &#39;em five Miles
distance from all Market-Towns; and at last the Acts made against <em>Papists</em>
were extended to them. But since King <em>William</em>&#39;s Revolution the Case is
alter&#39;d; for the <em>Jacobite Clergy</em>, though turn&#39;d out of their Livings by
Law, for refusing Allegiance to the King, yet from the Allegiance they bare to
the Bishops, they find such Favour from their Lordships, that if the Livings
they lose are in the Bishops gift, he shall present any Friend which the
dispossessed <em>Jacobite</em> shall recommend; now what can be more by them
desired, than to enjoy the Profits of their Livings, and put in what Curate they
please? And after all, that they may enjoy the full Profits of their Livings,
and pay their Curates another way, these <em>Jacobites</em> may hold their
Conventicles where they please, nay, Preach publickly and seditiously in an open
Church near <em>Cheap-side, London</em>, without the least offence to the
Spiritual Power. And is it not plain (said this Gentleman) from all this, that
on this side the Water as well as on the other, the Clergies&#39; Zeal for their
Communion,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
Church and Religion, is only meant to support their own Party, Dominion and
Empire?</p>
<p>3. Now the oldest <em>Deists</em> of my Acquaintance having conceiv&#39;d so
great a Prejudice against the Christian Faith, from the Behaviour of the Clergy,
and having levened their Disciples therewith, it has fal&#39;n out unhappily, that
the late Revolution has by another way also confirmed them in this their
Prejudice.</p>
<p>For the late happy Revolution, (which came on too soon, and was cut off too
short) though it was not so highly beneficial to us, as was by some expected,
was yet of very great Importance. But as there is nothing in this World ever so
good, but what hath some appending disadvantage; so by meer Accident this
Revolution, which has saved not only the Church of <em>England</em>, but (as I
hope) the whole Protestant Interest throughout the World, has wonderfully
encreased Mens Prejudices against the <em>Clergy</em>, and so by false
Consequence (such as Men through Resentment will make) against the Truth of
Religion it self. The old <em>Deists</em> tell those of their Pupils, who never
travelled abroad, that there is now no need of going over the Water to discover
that the name <em>Church</em> signifieth only a <em>Self-interested Party</em>,
and that the <em>Clergy</em> have no Godliness but Gain. Have you not (say they)
for many Years together heard them Preach up the <em>Divine Right</em>, and
indefeizable Authority of Kings, together with <em>Passive Obedience</em>, as
the chief distinguishing Doctrines whereby their Church approved it self <em>
Apostolick</em> beyond all other Churches? Nay, were not the Doctrines of <em>
Loyalty to the King</em>, insisted upon more than <em>Faith in Christ</em>? and
yet when their particular Interest required it, their Doctrine of <em>
Non-Resistance</em><span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
was qualify&#39;d by <em>Non-Assistance</em>, the whole Stream of Loyalty was turn&#39;d
from the King to the Church, the indefeizable Right was superseded by a
miraculous Conquest without Blood, the Oath of Allegiance to the <em>Divinely
Rightful King James</em> has its force allay&#39;d by another Oath of the same
Importance made to the <em>de facto</em> King <em>William</em> and Queen <em>
Mary</em>, and all this is Sanctify&#39;d by the name of the Church, <em>i.e.</em>
their own Party and Interest, for the sake whereof it is done. This is indeed
keeping to the Text-<em>Rem rem quocunque modo rem</em>.</p>

<hr class="c7" />

<p>And the wretched Defence they make for this their Apostacy (say the <em>
Deists</em>) maketh the matter worse. For notwithstanding King <em>James</em>
is, as they will have it, Conquer&#39;d; and his Throne, which was declared vacant,
is legally filled by one who by Act of Parliament is declared our Rightful King;
yet after all this Dr. S&mdash;&mdash; will reserve a Right to King <em>James</em>, though
through Success and Settlement he will allow a Right also to King <em>William</em>.
And this Notion the Clergy generally adhere to, because thereby they kill two or
three Birds with one stone. 1<em>st.</em> They preserve to themselves their
ancient Right of giving Titles to Sovereignty. For though both King and
Parliament have disclaimed and damned the Conquest, yet the Clergy still insist
upon it. 2<em>ly.</em> They make fair Weather with King <em>James</em>, by
keeping his Title alive, and by still asserting his Right, open him a Door to
recover his Possession again. For what honest Christian can oppose a Rightful
King in regaining the Possession of his Throne, which is kept from him by a
Successful Usurper? and 3<em>ly.</em> They think they have obliged King <em>
William</em> sufficiently by the formality of<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
an Oath, and owning him in his Possession. Put all this together and &#39;twill
prove, that</p>

<p class="blockquot"><em>When all the Argument is out,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &#39;Tis Interest still resolves the doubt.</em></p>

<p>Thus (cry they) you plainly see, that your Church is nothing but a Party, to
which whosoever joineth, himself shall find his Account thereby, notwithstanding
any Error, Heresy, Immorality or Disloyalty to the present Government
whatsoever; whilst any other who is conformable to the <em>Rubricks</em> and <em>
Canons</em>, whose Learning and Morals are an Honour to his Gown, and who is
truly dutiful to his Majesty, shall be excluded from all those benefits his
Profession would entitle him to. Thus the bold Asserters of King <em>James</em>&#39;s
Right enjoy some of the best Preferments, and particularly Dr. S&mdash;&mdash; sits D&mdash;&mdash; of
St. P&mdash;&mdash; whilst honest Mr. <em>Johnson</em> is starving upon Charity.</p>
<p>The Church of <em>England</em> is a meer Party, (say they again) and has a
Watch-word whereby they know one another, which they can vary upon occasion. <em>
Non-Resistance</em> was the Word in King <em>Charles</em>&#39;s days. For though at
that time you did conform to every tittle and ceremony, injoin&#39;d by Rubrick and
Canon, yet if you failed in the Point of <em>Non-Resistance</em>, you were a <em>
Phanatick</em> and <em>Republican</em>, a <em>Rebel</em>, and what not? Now if
this Doctrine be contain&#39;d in the Book of Homilies, as the <em>Jacobites</em>
say, &#39;tis a Sacred Record of the Unjustice of some of those who concurred in the
late Revolution. The <em>Shiboleth</em> of the Church now is King <em>William&#39;s
de facto Title</em>; And no Conformity to Homilies and Rubricks will make you
owned by the present Church, if you should acknowledge the<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
King to be otherwise said than a meer <em>de facto</em>. Now (say they) although
we grant that Men will submit to the Government, upon their own particular
Principles, and therefore &#39;tis reasonable that the King should admit the
Obedience of his Subjects upon what Grounds they please, yet we know no Reason
why the Church should set up the <em>de facto</em>, as the only Principle of
Obedience: And when the King had better Titles to his Crown, as the Consent of
the People in Parliament, and his Matrimonial Title with the Queen, yet he must
be made to pay the greatest price for the weakest and worst of all Titles; and
give Dr. <em>S</em>&mdash;&mdash; Sixteen Hundred Pounds a Year, for a <em>Defactoship</em>
only.</p>
<p>You see, Sir, that the <em>Deists</em> want not Occasions for their
Prejudices, how far soever they are from having Reason o&#39; their side. And pray
resolve me, why must this false Title be set up as &#39;twere by the King&#39;s Consent,
to worm out the only true one? Why must none be preferr&#39;d to Church-Dignities,
but such who come in upon this Title only? And those who own the King&#39;s Right
upon the Consent of the People, be still labouring under the Church&#39;s highest
displeasure? and poor <em>Johnson</em>, a Man against whom no Immorality was
ever objected, that is an Object even of the <em>Deists</em> Compassion, be left
to starve for the Cause? Nay, they have gone so far upon the Strength of Dr. <em>
S</em>&mdash;&mdash; Convocation-Title, in Opposition to that of Parliament, that since the
good Queen is dead, and the Consent of the People, according to them, null and
void; they have left the King a bare Possession, without any Title at all.</p>
<p>4. I am acquainted with a Gentleman, who for some Years has not gone to
Church, having taken offence at those Practices I was now writing upon. This
Man,<span class="pagenum">[14]</span> you
must know, had an extraordinary Veneration for the profound Learning (so he
thinks much reading and common-placing to be) of a certain Eminent Divine, who
had a fat Bishoprick bestow&#39;d on him by King <em>William</em> and Queen <em>Mary</em>.
But he to requite their Kindness, when a Bill was brought before the Lords,
declaring the King and Queen&#39;s rightful and lawful Title to the Crown, not only
opposed and voted against it in the House; but when it had passed, he entred his
Protestation against it in the Journal. Nay (said this Gentleman) if King <em>
William</em> be only King <em>de facto</em>, then the Bishop is <em>de facto</em>
only. Truly Sir, you may believe me, that I was amaz&#39;d at this Relation; for (as
I then said) though most Men look no further, than only to get Mony <em>de facto</em>,
and do not with much strictness inquire <em>quo jure</em>; yet &#39;twas strange
that any Man should protest that he had no right to that Estate, which he openly
continued in Possession of. But I was soon answer&#39;d by this his former Admirer,
that if that Bishop had strengthened his own Title to the Bishoprick from King <em>
J.</em> I might cease my wonder.</p>
<p>I am indeed sorry to hear Stories of this Nature, especially when they assure
me of the Truth of &#39;em, and when I see the ill Consequences of them. For though
nothing be more certain than that the Baseness and Falshood of Man can never
disprove the Truth of God; yet when Men are highly Scandaliz&#39;d, and greatly
deceived by those for whom they had Esteem, and by whose Authority they in great
measure governed themselves, they will stretch their Conclusion beyond their
Premisses, and disown Religion in their Principle, because &#39;tis disregarded by
some great Men in their Practice.</p>
<p>But though to strict Reasons, such Arguments for <em>Deism</em> appear
ridiculous; yet from the Promotion of these <em>de facto</em> Men, I am told,
hath arisen great disadvantage to the King, and those Subjects, whose Principles
and<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
Practices have been always faithful to his Majesties Interest: Since hereby it
is, that it hath always been in the power of the open and professed Enemies of
the King to oppress his most dutiful Subjects. For these <em>de facto</em>-men,
and the <em>Jacobites</em>, were but lately the same sort of People, both of the
same Principle and Temper. And though the <em>Jacobites</em> do now rail at
them, for their base Complyances (as they term it) with the <em>P.</em> of <em>O</em>&#39;s
Revolution; yet the <em>de factos</em> are unwilling, for old Acquaintance sake,
to pass by their Railing, and underhand to shew &#39;em any kindness: And this they
submit to, as being Self-conscious, that the <em>Jacobites</em> have a Right to
reproach them; so that they are willing to appease the anger of their old
Friends by their best Services. Now the <em>Jacobites</em> having always an
innate Hatred to the <em>Whigs</em>, (as they now stile all those who think
themselves obliged to own the King for their rightful Sovereign) and being
willing to keep up their old Master&#39;s Right to the Crown, (to which the <em>
Whigs</em> are irreconcileable Enemies) easily prevail upon these <em>de factos</em>
to oppress those other sort of Men, which is an Office they are as willing to
undertake, as the <em>Jacobites</em> can be to put it upon &#39;em. Thus it cometh
to pass, that according as an open professed Enemy to the Government shall
dictate, a Church-man shall strenuously exert that Power the King has given him,
to discourage and oppress his Dutiful and Loyal Subjects. I will only (said a
certain Person) make a Supposition, to shew you how this may be; suppose the
King should bestow a Bishoprick upon a <em>de facto</em> Doctor, and this Doctor
should there find his old Acquaintance Dr. <em>H.</em> and being a Stranger in
his Diocese, should be willing to instruct himself in the Characters of Men from
the good D., would it not fall out so, that the Clergy of that Diocese must be
used well or ill, as the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
most open and notorious Enemy the Government hath, shall design? And was it not
possible that the E. of <em>N.</em> might oblige his old Friends in the same
manner? Thus, though King <em>James</em> be at last excluded, his Subjects reign
in his stead. And whether an <em>Oath</em> of <em>Abjuration</em> laid upon the <em>
Jacobites</em> Proxy-men, will put an end to this Corruption, Time must tell us.</p>
<p>5. But to return to the Reasons, (or Prejudices I may rather call &#39;em) which
occasion <em>Deism</em>; It hath been observed to me, that where the Notion of a
Church hath been carried on with the highest Tide, there even natural Religion
is at the lowest Ebb; as in <em>Italy</em> of old, and lately in <em>France</em>,
where gross Immoralities and Atheism are at the greatest height. And though in
our Reformation we discarded some Idolatrous and Superstitious Doctrines and
Practices, which were grown scandalous among the People, yet still <em>Christ</em>
was made to serve that turn, which his Holy Vicar can no longer do, <em>viz.</em>
Support an Holy Order of Men in as haughty Insolences, in as proud, ambitious
and malicious Designs, as those which King <em>Henry</em> (though a Son of the
Church) and his Times could not bear. Now in answer to this, I bid these <em>
Deists</em> only read the <em>Bible</em>, and see if the Spirit of that Book be
not as good as their Thoughts can reach to; or let &#39;em read the Character of the
Christian Religion, given by Sir <em>Matthew Hale</em> in the first of his Three
Letters concerning Religion, where he saith, <em>It teacheth and tutors the Soul
to a high Reverence and Veneration of Almighty God, a sincere and upright
Walking, as in the Presence of the invisible all-seeing God. It makes a Man
truly love to Honour, to Obey him, and therefore careful to know what his Will
is: It renders the Heart highly thankful to him, both as his Creator, Redeemer
and Benefactor: It makes a Man entirely to depend upon, to seek to him for
Guidance</em><span class="pagenum">[17]</span> <em>
and Direction, and Protection, to submit to his Will with all Patience, and
Resignation of Soul: It gives the Law not only to his Words and Actions, but to
his very Thoughts and Purposes: It bringeth Man to such a Deportment both of
External and Internal Sobriety, as may be decent in the Presence of God and his
holy Angels: It crusheth and casts down all Pride and Haughtiness, both in a
Man&#39;s Heart and Carriage, and gives him an humble frame of Soul and Life, both
in the sight of God and Men: It regulates and governs the Passions of the Mind,
and brings them into due moderation and frame: It gives a Man a right estimate
of this present World; and sets the Heart and Hopes above it, so that he never
loves it more than it deserves. It makes the Wealth and Glory of this World,
high Places and great Preferments, but of a low and little value to him, so that
he is neither covetous nor ambitious, nor over-sollicitous concerning the
advantages of it: It brings a Man to that frame, that Righteousness, Justice,
Honesty and Fidelity, is as &#39;twere part of his Nature; he can sooner dye than
commit or purpose that which is unjust, dishonest or unworthy a good Man: It
makes him value the love of God and Peace of Conscience above all the Wealth and
Honours in the World, and be very vigilant to keep it inviolably: Though he be
under a due Apprehension of the Love of God, yet it keeps him humble and
watchful, and free from all Presumption; so that he dares not under a vain
Confidence of the Indulgence of God, commit or purpose the least injury to man:
He performs all his Duties to God in Sincerity, Integrity and Constancy; and
while he lives on Earth, his Conversation, his Hopes, his Treasure, and the
Flower of his Expectation is in Heaven; and he entirely endeavours to walk
suitably to such a Hope. In Sum, it restores the Image of God unto the Soul in
Righteousness and true Holiness.</em><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>
<p>I prevail&#39;d upon one of my Friends, a <em>Deist</em>, to read those three
Letters, because therein the Substance of the Christian Religion is
distinguish&#39;d from the Circumstantials and Appendages; for want of which
distinction being well understood, <em>Deism</em> has arose, as that great Man
in the fore-cited Letter hath observed. <em>When Men</em> (says he) <em>see so
much Religion placed by Professors of Christianity in these things which every
intelligent Man values but as Forms, or Inventions, or Modes, or Artifices, and
yet as great weight laid upon them, as great fervour and animosity us&#39;d for or
against them, as almost for any Points of Christian Religion; They are apt
presently to censure and throw off all Religion, and reckon all of the same
make.</em> Thus that Upright Judge, whose three Letters my Friend having read,
did well approve of &#39;em, acknowledging, that with great Exactness he had
distinguished between Religion and Priest-craft: And he added, If you will shew
me, Sir, any Christian Church where that distinction is observed, I will become
a Member of it. I recommended the Church of <em>England</em>; he presently told
me that he had read the 39 Articles, and observed that 3 of them were wholly
design&#39;d to uphold the Power of the Clergy over the People. And then he had me
only compare the <em>Design</em>, which has been, and still is, carrying on
under the Name of the Church of <em>England</em>, with the Design of the
Christian Religion, as &#39;tis described by Sir <em>Matthew Hale</em>; and I should
find the one in all its parts a Contradiction to the other. &#39;Tis plain (<em>said
he</em>) the Clergy do not allow of Sir <em>Matthew</em>&#39;s Notions, nor will
they suffer us to take any thing for Religion, that is distinguished from their
particular Interest. To what end have so many Persecutions and Penal Laws been
set a foot by the Clergy in Christendom? was it to bring Men to any one Point of
that full Description of Christian Religion,<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
which you cited from Sir <em>Matthew Hale</em>? or only to bring them to that
short Article of their Clergy Religion, <em>i.e.</em> to submit to their Power?
Did not the Honourable Sir <em>R. H.</em> lately write a Treatise, wherein with
great Learning and accurate Judgment he distinguished betwixt Religion and
Priest-craft? and was he not treated for it with a true Priestly Insolence and
Malice in the Pulpit at <em>White-hall</em>, by <em>A.</em> one of their
Majesties Chaplains, and represented as a Scorner and an Atheist, because he
scorns to submit to any Religion but what is of Christ&#39;s Institution? Suppose a
Man should govern himself by the Law of <em>Christ</em>, and go no further, is
there any Christian Church which would own such an one for a Member? If you will
be a Son of the Church of <em>England</em> you must hold Kings and Bishops to be <em>
jure divino</em>, the Apostolical Doctrine of <em>Passive Obedience</em>; you
must not be indifferent to their Ceremonies, though declar&#39;d but indifferent
things; and the Reason is, because you must have a profound Respect for the
Power of the Bishops, by which these Ceremonies were ordain&#39;d: And besides this,
you must shew a perfect Abhorrence of all who do not submit to the Spiritual
Royalties of their Diocesan Bishops; for your Churchmanship will not appear by
any Mark so well, as by the Hatred you bear to all Dissenters, in Conjunction
with a deep aversion to all the ancient Rights and just Liberties of your Native
Country. In fine, (<em>said he</em>) when your Clergy Preach the Law of <em>
Christ</em> without turning it to any By-end, or false Interest, you shall meet
me at Church. You know the Clergy love Precedency of the Laity; Let them turn
Christians first, and I can follow.</p>
<p>6. I have known some, who have alledged as a Reason why they have forsaken
the Christian Faith, the impossibility of Believing. Many Doctrines (<em>say
these</em>) are made necessary to Salvation, which &#39;tis impossible to believe,<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
because they are in their nature Absurdities. I replied, That these things were <em>
Mysteries</em>, and so above our Understanding. But he asked me to what end
could an unintelligible Doctrine be revealed? not to instruct, but to puzzle and
amuse. What can be the effect of an unintelligible <em>Mystery</em> upon our
Minds, but only Amusement? That which is only above Reason must be above a
rational Belief, and must I be Saved by an irrational Belief? If a Proposition
be inconsistent with it self, I cannot but believe it to be false: &#39;Twas once to
serve a Turn against the <em>Papists</em> your Church held all Doctrines
necessary to save Souls, were plainly revealed in Scripture; How could you say
plainly revealed unless you understood the Revelation? Besides, I cannot think
that the belief of any unprofitable Doctrines, <em>i.e.</em> such as admit of no
Application to Moral Duties, can be a saving Faith so much as in part; nor can I
imagine that Faith tends to save a Soul, because what we believe is only <em>
True</em>, (for so the belief of <em>Euclids Elements</em> might have a saving
Effect upon Souls) but because our Belief is <em>Good</em>, it has a practical
Effect, and tends to make us better Men. Besides, you all agree the Belief of
your Trinity is absolutely necessary to Salvation, and yet widely differ in <em>
what</em> we must believe concerning it; whether three Minds or Modes, or
Properties, or internal Relations, or Oeconomies, or Manifestations, or external
Denominations; or else no more than a Holy Three, or Three Somewhats; or
otherwise only one of these Three to be God in the highest Sense, and each of
the other two to be a God without Self-subsistence and Independence. I am
confident, if I should be perswaded that an Explanation of the <em>Trinity</em>
were necessary to save my Soul, and see the Learned so widely differing and
hotly disputing what it is I must believe concerning it, I should certainly run
mad through despair of finding<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
out the Truth: But since these Doctors cannot agree which Party of &#39;em shall
captivate my Belief in Obedience to his Faith, I will reserve it to be the
Hand-maid of Truth; whenever she appears she shall command it.</p>
<p>7. I remember one Gentleman objected to the Christian Faith, that it made Men
insolent, quarrelsom and ill-natur&#39;d. From whence I concluded, (as I told him)
that he had never read over the <em>Gospels</em>; truly he could not say that he
had read &#39;em carefully, but yet that in reading the History of what had passed
in Christendom, he observed that most of the Quarrels in which this part of the
World had been engaged, arose from Contentions among the Christian <em>
Priesthood</em>. Church-History is chiefly a Relation of Church-mens Wrangles,
and D. <em>Cave</em> in a late Book of his had denominated every Century from
some eminent Quarrel which arose among the Clergy. But besides this, what was
the Holy War, what all the holy Massacres and Croisados which filled <em>Europe</em>
with Blood, but the Inventions of Holy Church? And what is holy Inquisition, but
a perpetual Series of Murthers carry&#39;d on in barbarous Forms of Law against the
common Sense of Mankind? Does History account for any Barbarities so great as
those committed by the Popes? Any Cruelties so savage as those of the Holy
Inquisition? Any Murthers so solemn, and religiously brutal as the Acts of
Faith? Any Pragmaticalness so insufferable as that of the Jesuits? is not their
Humanity extinguished by their Christian Religion? such is their Malice that no
Man can eat Bread where they have to do, unless he submit his Faith to their
guidance, witness the present <em>French</em> Persecution. Nor can any Sovereign
Prince keep his Word or Oath, though he had only sworn to maintain those Laws by
which he Reigns as King, any longer than this Spiritual Fatherhood will give him
leave,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span> as <em>
Lewis</em> XIV. of <em>France</em>, and <em>James</em> II. of <em>England</em>
do witness. Let these Inhumanities be considered, as supported and carried on by
the name of Catholick Church, and (if the Devils believe) you may as decently
say Church of <em>Hell</em> as Church of <em>Rome</em>.</p>
<p>And as Devotion, continu&#39;d our <em>Deist</em>, to holy Church is the center
upon which all things turn on the other side the Water, so is it the same thing
here. Do not our Priesthood of <em>England</em> make as high Pretences to
dispose of all Offices and Trusts in the Kingdom, to those of their own Faction,
as those of <em>Rome</em>? Have they not long since got their Bill of Exclusion
to be passed into a Law, whereby no Man can enjoy a Place of Profit or Trust in
the State, but whom they qualify at their Altars? where Men were capacitated to
be Bumbails, keep Gaming-houses and sell Ale. What was it but the Insolence of
the Priesthood that brought about Father <em>Laud</em>&#39;s and Father <em>Peter</em>&#39;s
Revolutions? Besides (said he) do you not observe what a keen Edge Christian
Faith puts upon the ill-nature of Divines, when they are disputing about matters
of Religion? &#39;Tis common for Philosophers, Lawyers, Physicians, <em>&amp;c.</em> to
differ about matters which concern their Professions, and write one against
another: But you will find some Temper and Decorum observed in their Writings.
But let the Controversy be about any Branch of Christian Faith; and then see the <em>
Odium Theologorum</em>, the Malice of Divines in the late Writings of two of
your Church Doctors against each other; at least this shews that Christian Faith
doth not improve the Temper of such Men who are of mean Birth, and narrow
Education. And I cannot but observe, that your <em>Protestant</em> Malice is
under a worse Management than the <em>Popish</em>; they only thirst for the
Blood of Protestants, but you are for sucking one anothers Blood; as when for
the Service<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
of King <em>Charles</em> the II. (who was Head of your Church) and his Popish
Brother, the Blood of the best Protestants in <em>England</em>, (and some of
them of your own Church) was to be spilt, the Court Blood-suckers, <em>viz.</em>
Attorney general, and Judges, besides Juries and Evidence, were all of &#39;em
chosen Men out of your own Church; and the <em>Posse</em> of the Clergy was
raised to hold their Heads to the Block, by Preaching the Doctrine of <em>
Passive Obedience</em>.</p>
<p>But in requital, it must be confessed, that your Clergy require the King to
do their Persecuting Journey-work with the same Insolence as the Popish
Priesthood use; For must not the Sovereign Monarch of <em>England</em>, <em>
Scotland</em>, <em>France</em> and <em>Ireland</em>, by his Authority Royal,
execute the Decrees and Anathema&#39;s of the Arch-deacons and Bishops Chancellors,
by Imprisoning his loyal and useful Subjects, for not conforming to their
Ceremonies? If a King will submit to this Drudgery, he shall have the <em>vox
Cleri</em> of his side, and be as great as Noise and fulsom Flattery can make
him; but in the mean time is really King but of one Moiety of his People, whilst
the danger which the other half apprehend from the Secular Arm directed by
Spiritual Power of Necessity, weaneth their Hearts from the Government. Thus <em>
Charles</em> the II. who for two Years after his Return, reigned in the Hearts
of all his People, was by the Act of Uniformity reduced to be King of the
Church-party; and at last, whilst the <em>Popish</em> and <em>Protestant</em>
Priesthood zealously contended whose Property he should be, (like the Truth
among Controversial Divines) he was lost in the Scuffle.</p>
<p>He instanced in likewise the late King <em>James</em>, who (said he) had it
in his power to be universally beloved and obey&#39;d, beyond any King of <em>
England</em> this Age has produced. His Right to the Crown was owned by all; his
Wilfulness had passed upon the Church of <em>England</em><span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
Party for Magnanimous Resolution, which struck such an Awe upon them, that they
were coming to a Temper, and would have consented to a Toleration of Protestant
Dissenters, and <em>Roman</em> Catholicks too, provided their Maintenance might
be continued to them. Thus the Heart of all <em>England</em> had been set upon
the King; but the Popish Priesthood would be content with nothing less than
delivering the whole Nation to Satan, and their King must execute the dreadful
Anathema, though &#39;twas manifest that he must thereby lessen himself to the size
of one of the 7 Kings of <em>Kent</em>; for he could be Sovereign of no more
than the Two hundredth part of the People. For King <em>Charles</em> in
numbering the People, had found that the Proportion between <em>Papist</em> and <em>
Protestant</em> was as 1 to 200: whereas had his own Priesthood been so
favourable to him, as to have excused him from executing that Satanical Power,
which by a Right purely Divine was vested in Sacred Majesty, his Reign might
have been happy, and his Memory precious. What an unhappy Effect had the Spirit
of Father <em>Laud</em> upon King <em>Charles</em> the First? And what hath
brought <em>Lewis</em> the XIV. to the present Diminution of his Glory, but that
haughty Insolence and unnatural Cruelty in Persecuting his own Subjects, which
Father <em>la Chaise</em> has inspired him with? What Figure will this Grand
Monarch make in Story? His Name will pollute the Annals of this Age, and his
cowardly Conquests be the Scorn of Posterity. Now from all that he had said, he
concluded, that for Luck-sake, as well as to preserve his good Nature, he would
be cautious of being (at least) a zealous Christian.</p>
<p>8. &#39;Twas not long since I met one of my old Acquaintance, who told me that he
had lately cast off these Prejudices he had conceived against the Christian
Faith, by the Assistance of a Book called, <em>The Five Letters of Inspiration.</em><span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
By the last of those Letters he was convinced of the reality of reveal&#39;d
Religion, from the Intrinsick value and Excellency thereof; and he was fully
confirmed in his Judgment by a late Book called, <em>The Reasonableness of
Christianity, as delivered in the Scripture</em>. Upon this, he had read over
the <em>Old-Testament</em> once, and the <em>New</em> several times, with great
attention of Mind. Indeed he always thought the Moral part of the <em>Bible</em>
very good; but then he also thought, that by the strength of his own Reason, he
could have written as good a Moral himself. But by the last of these Books he
was convinced, that he was indebted to <em>Revelation</em> more than he thought
of, and considering how long the Ceremonial Law had obtain&#39;d among the <em>Jews</em>,
and what a profound respect they paid to the Scribes, Pharisees, and Spiritual
Guides and Rulers; he plainly saw that there was need enough of Miracle to bear
down their Prejudices, to make &#39;em leave their Ceremonies, and listen to that
excellent Moral which Christ gave &#39;em; nay, he was convinced that no Miracles
were strong enough to prevail over the Priest, or a Priest-ridden People, to
become Proselytes to the Doctrine of universal Love and Charity; for (said he)
if a Teacher should now be sent from Heaven with this Message, that all the
Protestant Parties in <em>England</em> should be reconciled and live well with
one another, making nothing necessary to their religious Communion, but what
Christ had appointed, and such Circumstances as Time and Place, and what in the
nature of the thing was needful, and if this Teacher&#39;s Mission were confirm&#39;d by
Miracle, it would have (as he thought) no better effect upon our several Sects
of Clergy, and those who are bigotted to their Parties, than it had upon the <em>
Pharisees</em> and their Disciples of old.</p>
<p>Having heard him speak so sharply against the Clergy after his old way, I
could not but tell him that I perceived<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
he was but almost a Christian; for he who loveth the Institution of Christ,
cannot but respect those who are the Ministers thereof; at least, I hoped that
he would pay a respect to the Clergy of the Church of <em>England</em>, which
was the best Reformed Church in the World; and therefore I expected that he was
already a Member of our Church: He reply&#39;d, that he should always be ready to
pay his respect to every good Man of what Order or Degree soever; he should
always be willing to hear a good Minister Preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to
him, and exhort him to the sincere Practice of it. That he was ready to
contribute his share to the Maintenance of such Ministers, and to join with that
Church-of-<em>England</em> Congregation near to which he liv&#39;d, in publick
Worship; but yet he could not condemn the Worship of other Congregations, nor
exclude himself from joyning with them as occasion should serve him. So that as
to Church-membership he could be a Member of any Church, which would own him
upon the terms of Faith and Practice, contained in the Book he mentioned,
concerning the Reasonableness of the <em>Christian Religion</em>, &amp;c. But still
he conceiv&#39;d, that Church-Communion in holy Offices was designed only to raise
his Devotion towards God, not towards the Clergy, which made him admire the
unparallell&#39;d Impudence of the <em>Roman</em> Priesthood, who measure the
Religion of all Christians by their Devotion to the See of <em>Rome</em>, i.e.
indeed to themselves; and he doubted whether any Church were sufficiently
Reformed from Popery, which made any Doctrines of Faith necessary to Salvation
that were not declared so in the Gospels, and where the Clergy would always
distinguish between Church and State, and give the Precedency to themselves. But
yet he would join with any Church as far as it promoted the Honour of God, and
separate from it, wherein on pretence of Religion, he saw, that it aimed at a
By-end of its own.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>
<p>Here I urged him again to joyn to our Church, which had no other design but
God&#39;s Glory. To this he said, that he should be glad that the Church of <em>
England</em> would own him, though he could not be of their Party: He would
willingly pass as a Church-man for his Credit-sake; for (said he) though a Man
doth ever so firmly believe Jesus Christ to be the Messiah whom God had of old
promised, and in due time sent to give us a perfect Rule of Life, in order to
make us truly religious here, and ever happy hereafter; and though a Man should
shew forth his Faith by an agreeable course of Life, in doing Justice, loving
Mercy, and an humble walking with God; yet if he were not owned as a Member of
some Church, he would by all Churches be accounted, if not an Atheist, yet a
Sceptic, a Man of no settled Principle, but own who has his Religion to choose.
For if you look over the State of Religion as it standeth in Christendom, there
is no Church whatsoever which will accept you as a Member of its Communion, but
upon some particular terms of Belief, or Practice, which Christ never appointed,
and it may be such as an honest and a wise Christian cannot consent to. I am not
more able to give up my Reason to the Church of <em>England</em>, than to give
up my Senses to the Church of <em>Rome</em>; it looks like a Trick in all
Churches to take away the use of Mens Reason, that they may render us Vassals
and Slaves to all their Dictates and Commands. But what greater slavery than to
force on Men a Belief of such things as necessary to Salvation, of which &#39;tis
not possible to form any Idea? Though I am satisfied there is no such thing as a
change of Bread into the Flesh of Christ, yet I can form an Idea, that such a
thing may be, that the same Power which changed Earth into a Man, may change
Bread into Flesh: But I can frame to my self no Idea of what your Church
Teacheth in the Sacrament,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
that the Body and Blood of Christ are <em>verily and indeed taken and received
of the faithful</em>: And when I ask how can this be understood by a Protestant,
who believeth that there is no other Body but that of Bread? I am told that the
Church meaneth it in a Spiritual Sense. Now I have try&#39;d, and find it impossible
for me to form to my self an Idea of a Body verily and indeed in a Spiritual
Sense.</p>
<p>And therefore I must say &#39;tis an unwise and a hard Thing for any Church to
impose absurd or unintelligible Notions (especially such Speculations, which
tend to make no body the better) as necessary to Salvation; for Wise Men, and
such who will take Courage to examine what they Believe, will not submit to such
an Usurpation; and weak Men are kept all their Life long in Fears and Doubts of
their Eternal State, as being always uncertain whether they firmly believe such
Doctrines, or no.</p>
<p>Besides this (said he) your Church will require me to believe other
Absurdities as bad as these, as that Kings and Bishops have a Divine Right to
that Power, which they exercise over us, whereas with my own Eyes I saw our
Great and Gracious King accept the Crown of <em>England</em>, as the Gift of the
People. And I see as plainly, that Bishops are an Order of Men of their own (not
of Christ&#39;s) making. I was told that our Bishops Order was founded in that of
the 12 Apostles, and the Presbyters Order in the 70 Disciples: Upon this I
resolved to see if the 12 and the 70 were different Orders, or no, and read over
the 10th Chap. of <em>Matthew</em>, the 3d and 6th of <em>Mark</em>, and the 9th
of <em>Luke</em>, in which places the Power which Christ gave to the 12 is set
forth, which amounteth to this, <em>viz.</em> a Charge to Preach the Gospel, a
Power to work Miracles in casting out Devils, healing the Sick, <em>&amp;c.</em> And
I also read in the 10th Chapter of <em>Luke</em>, that<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
the 70 were sent forth for the same Reason, and with the same express Power as
were the 12, <em>viz.</em> To preach the Gospel, heal the Sick, and cast out
Devils, <em>vers.</em> 2.9.17. And he telleth the 70 at the 16th Verse, <em>That
he who heareth them, heareth him; and he who despiseth them, despiseth him</em>,
as he had said to the 12, in <em>Matthew</em> 10.40. Indeed they were only added
to the number of the 12, <em>Because</em> (as &#39;tis said there) <em>the Harvest
was great, and the Labourers few</em>, i.e. because Multitudes followed Christ,
and were disposed to become Christians, therefore he encreased the number of his
Apostles, or Teaching Disciples. I can find no Footsteps of any Jurisdiction
given to the 12 over the 70, or indeed over any body else; and in the 18th
Chapter of <em>Matthew</em>, where Christ speaketh of binding and loosing, &#39;tis
manifest from the first Verse, that his discourse was made to his Disciples. So
in the 20th of <em>John</em>, the Holy-Ghost and Power of remitting and
retaining Sins, was given to the Disciples which met together after Christ&#39;s
death, <em>vers.</em> 19. in which meeting, there might be some of the 70 as
well as some of the 12: &#39;Tis certain the 70 received the Holy-Ghost, and if
Baptism be a Key of Admission into the Church, they had it: If binding or
loosing be declaring wherein we are bound in duty, and wherein we may use our
liberty; if remitting and retaining Sins be declaring what Iniquity God will
forgive, and what he will not; the 70 shared this Power with the 12. As for
delivering up to Satan, and inflicting Diseases; since &#39;twas a miraculous Power,
which we read not that Christ appropriated to the 12, we have no reason to think
&#39;twas detained from the 70. If then Christ appointed but one Order, <em>viz.</em>
that of Teachers, the Order of Rulers dignified themselves above, and
distinguished themselves from their Brethren, yet I am willing to submit to
those Powers, which the Laws of<span class="pagenum">[30]</span> <em>
England</em> have given to the Bishops, though what they claim by Divine Right,
I esteem as an Usurpation.</p>
<p>Moreover (says he) although I am become a Christian, I have not ceased to be
an <em>English-man</em>, and for that reason cannot be in party with the
Bishops, who by their false-prerogative Doctrines, and other shameful
Assistances, so lately betray&#39;d the Charters and Liberties, Rights and
Privileges of their Country, were setting up an absolute irresistible Power in
K. <em>Charles</em> II. which being demised to K. <em>James</em>, endangered not
only the Liberty and Property, but Body and Soul of the Nation. Nor can I so
soon forget how their long debates, about admitting the <em>P.</em> of <em>
Orange</em>, our Good and Great King, to the Sovereignty, was the occasion of
spilling so much Protestant Blood in <em>Ireland</em>; nor the late Protestation
of some of the chief of their Party against his Majesties Right to the Crown;
nor how careful they have been since, that (as it now falls out) he should have
no pretence to any rightful Title. If any Clergy-man was so honest as to Preach
up his Right, as justly grounded on the Consent of the People, (as Mr. <em>
Johnson</em> for instance) he must lie under pain of the Church&#39;s highest
displeasure, though otherwise ever so Orthodox and Conformable; so that since
the beloved Title of Conquest is burnt by the Parliament, and the Matrimonial
Title is (to the great grief of all good Men) dead and buried with the Queen; it
remaineth according to Holy Church, that he hath no Title at all, but only bare
Possession; and this they mean when they call him <em>de facto</em>.</p>
<p>But I cannot find that they will allow him to be King of the Clergy so much
as <em>de facto</em>. Alas! his Livings, whereby alone he is capable to oblige
them to call to mind their now forgotten Loyalty, which of late years they
preached up, as the summ of the Law and the Prophets;<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
Alas! these good Things are taken out of his hands by the Conquering Bishops,
that the Clergy may have a separate Interest from the State on this side the
Water, and be led to pay an intire Allegiance to the holy Order. When <em>Hen.</em>
VIII. came to know that his Bishops swore Allegiance to the <em>Pope</em>, he
began to think of some ways and means how to make himself King of his Clergy,
which he saw could not be done but by casting out the <em>Pope</em>&#39;s Power; and
hence sprung that King&#39;s Reformation of his Politicks, rather than Religion. And
if our good King were sensible of the Reasons why an <em>English</em> Papacy is
settled in a Committee of Six, <em>viz.</em> to fix the Obedience of the Clergy
on themselves exclusively, (for no Man can serve two Masters) I doubt not but he
would think fit to demand what is so much wanted, <em>viz.</em> the Allegiance
of the Clergy to their King; if he dissolves this Committee he may ask and have,
for where their Treasure is, there their Hearts will be also. For these Reasons
(said he) I shall be cautious how I enter into Church-membership, since I
plainly see that every Party of Christians embodied, organized, clergy&#39;d and
modelled into a National Church, casteth an awe upon the Sovereign Power, and
suffereth it not to provide equally for the Common Good of the Subject; but will
appropriate the <em>salus publica</em>, and influence the Government to serve
its own particular, its own private Ends.</p>
<p>Thus, Sir, I have given you an account of those Prejudices, which have
brought forth <em>Deism</em>. But yet these very Prejudices without a strong
assistance of Passion, could never have wrought upon Men to cast off Revelation;
for you see the same Prejudices remain in the <em>Deist</em> turn&#39;d Christian.
Whosoever therefore, upon the fore-mentioned Reasons turneth <em>Deist</em>,
cannot be excused, tho&#39; I could heartily wish all these Pretences could be taken
away from<span class="pagenum">[32]</span> &#39;em.
I am far from begrudging the Bishops and Clergy that small Maintenance, which by
Law is settled upon them; and, I hope, they have no other aim in discharging
their Offices, but to save our Souls, by imprinting on our Hearts the Reason,
the Excellency and Advantages of the Law of Christ. I hope also, that they
comport themselves to the Common Interest of their Native Country, and of the
Protestant Religion throughout the World. Truly I could wish that Notional
Divinity were laid aside for Practical; and that unintelligible Mysteries were
not insisted on, as matters of necessary Belief. He, who lately wrote his
Thoughts of the Causes and Occasions of Atheism, might have consider&#39;d, that he,
who cloggeth the Notion of God with Absurdities, mis-leadeth Men beyond <em>
Deism</em>. I pray God give me his Grace, by which I may sincerely conform my
self to the Law of Christ, and I will never concern my self with the Speculative
Drs. in Divinity. And I heartily join with our Church in that Petition, <em>Give
grace, O heavenly Father, to all Bishops and Curates, that they may both by
their Life and Doctrine, set forth thy true and lively Word, and rightly and
duly Administer thy holy Sacraments</em>. By this they would bring Souls to
Heaven, gain the Love of all good People, secure their own Temporal Interests,
stop the Mouths of their Adversaries, and compel the Deists to become
Christians.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
